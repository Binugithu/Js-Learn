formula: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meters).

Your task is to write some code to help them:

Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called massMark, heightMark, massJohn and heightJohn.

Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in two variables called BMIMark and BMIJohn.

Log the value of BMIMark and BMIJohn to the console.

BONUS: Create a boolean variable markHigherBMI containing information about whether Mark has a higher 
BMI than John. Log it to the console too */

1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:

"Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".

2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the outputs.

Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!".*/
