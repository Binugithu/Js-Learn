There are two gymnastics teams: Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

Your tasks:

2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print to the console:

"Dolphins win the trophy" if Dolphins win, or

"Koalas win the trophy" if Koalas win, or

/*Steven needs a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes to eat in a restaurant.
 In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different,
the tip is 20%.
Your tasks:
Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called tip for this. It's not allowed 
to use an if...else statement (if it's easier for you, you can start with an if...else statement, and 
then try to convert it to a ternary operator).
Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip).
Example: The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25.
Note: Use the values of the bill and tip variables to construct this string. Don't hard-code them ðŸ™‚
TEST DATA: Test with different bill values: 275, 40, and 430
HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
HINT 2: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰*/

/*CHALLENGE #1
Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline,
 which works differently.
Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score 
per team).
A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!
Your tasks:
Create an arrow function calcAverage to calculate the average of 3 scores. This function should have 
three parameters and return a single number (the average score).
Create two new variables â€” scoreDolphins and scoreKoalas, and assign the value returned from the 
calcAverage function to them (you will need to call this function, and pass scores as arguments).
Create a function checkWinner that takes the average score of each team as parameters (avgDolphins and
avgKoalas), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the 
rule above. Example: Koalas win (30 vs. 13) (use avgDolphins and avgKoalas instead of hard-coded values).
Use the checkWinner function to determine the winner for both DATA 1 and DATA 2.
Ignore draws this time. Instead, log No team wins... to the console if there is no winner.
TEST DATA 1: Dolphins scored 44, 23, and 71. Koalas scored 65, 54, and 49.
TEST DATA 2: Dolphins scored 85, 54, and 41. Koalas scored 23, 34, and 27.

Steven wants you to improve his tip calculator, using the same rules as before â€” tip 15% of the bill if 
the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is 20%.
Your tasks:
Write a function calcTip that takes any bill value as an input and returns the corresponding tip, 
calculated based on the rules above (you can check out the code from the first tip calculator challenge 
if you need to). Use the function type you like the most. Test the function using a bill value of 100.
And now let's use arrays! So, create an array called bills containing the test data below.
Create an array called tips containing the tip value for each bill, calculated from the function you 
created before.
BONUS: Create an array totals containing the total values, so the bill + tip.
TEST DATA: 125, 555, and 44.*/

Create a calcBMI method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same method on both objects). Assign the BMI value to a property called bmi (lowercase), and also return it from the method.
Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Example: "John Smith's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark Miller's (23.9)!".
